                        <h4>   INSPIRATION BEHIND THE NAME</h4>					

                        <p>The name Lillysparrows is coined from the  analogy about the lillies of the field and the sparrows of the air in the Bible, in which God displays how much he cares. He loves his creation. He loves us. It is purely by the grace and love of God that the lillies, blossom... and the sparrows, reach up high into the sky. If God is careful about them.... he is even more careful about us. He instructs not to worry because he's got us.</p>
                        <p><q> "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the sparrows; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?  And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.  Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.

                                The Lillies do not worry about blossoming, the do not struggle... yet God arrays them with so much splendor. The sparrows do not worry also... they fly and God keeps them from falling, he feeds them daily. So learn not to worry about anything... God is still in action. He loves you much more than these. 
                            </q></p>

                        <p>
                            So every time you see the Lillies or the Sparrows... Remember how much God loves you.... bask in his grace... embrace his love.
                        </p>

                        <h4>FULLY DEVOTED - <cite>Living each day by his word</cite> </h4>
                        This is an on-line daily devotional created based on the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This category is the main object of this website and our vision revolves around it.
                        The Vision is to prepare Gods people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
                        We hope to do this by sharing the word of God each day with our on-line community accompanied by brief reflections of the writer and prayers based on the word for the day.
                        We believe that since since 'In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was GOD' living each day by his word is living each day by God.
                        Remain blessed.
